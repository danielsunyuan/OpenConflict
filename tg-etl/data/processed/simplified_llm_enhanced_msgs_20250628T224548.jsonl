Although Trump brokered a ceasefire after 12 days of conflict, the Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) says the maritime threat remains elevated.\n\nWindward identified 55 vessels that broadcast 101 atypical messages between June 12 and 24 across the Gulf and Red Sea. The goal appears to be distancing ships from Western ties, particularly the U.S., UK, and Israel, which are perceived as higher-risk targets.\n\nExamples from recent days include a Panama-flagged container ship en route to Pakistan broadcasting “PKKHI all Chinese,” and a China-flagged supertanker initially broadcasting “Chinese ship” before switching to “CN NBG” — its port in Ningbo — after clearing the Strait. A Singapore-flagged container ship crossing the Red Sea signaled “Vsl no link Israel.”\n\nOn June 24, commercial ship traffic through the Strait of Hormuz spiked 30%, just one day after the ceasefire. Roughly one-fifth of global oil supply passes through the strait.\n\nJMIC also warned of increasing GPS jamming and electronic interference in the region, which can throw ships off course and raise the risk of collisions.\n\nSource: Reuters", "telegram_url": "https://t.me/ClashReport/49563", "media_type": "MessageMediaPhoto", "geolocation": {"lat": 31.0461, "lon": 34.8516, "confidence": 0.9450000000000001, "source": "country_centroid_override", "place_name": "Israel"}}
