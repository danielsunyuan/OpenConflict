At the time, the United States actively discussed a preemptive strike on North Korea. Former Defense Secretary **William Perry** wrote in detail about the preparation for this operation in his memoirs.\n\n‚ùìMore than **30 years** have passed, the realities in North Korea have changed, but is a strike possible? The mood in the local media is ambiguous, but the prevailing answer is that __such an operation is unlikely.__\n\nüñçFirstly, unlike Iran, North Korea is already a **nuclear power de facto**. Moreover, Pyongyang's ability to inflict damage on the Americans exceeds that of Tehran.\n\nüö©Secondly, Pyongyang has two allies - **Beijing** and **Moscow**. According to two treaties, if one side is attacked, the other must provide military assistance.\n\nAnd although China's participation in a hypothetical conflict remains a debatable issue, the \"testing\" of the Russian-North Korean treaty in the **Kursk region** showed that this document does work. This means that the likelihood of Russia's participation on the side of its ally is greatly increased.\n\n‚û°Ô∏èWhat the local media calls __\"Kim's obsession with nuclear weapons\"__ is now effectively saving North Korea from the Iranian scenario. The current situation also adds points against the formulations about **the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula** - a mantra that was considered the basis for any negotiations with the North Koreans.\n\n‚ùóÔ∏èTherefore, any possible dialogue, whether the US, its allies, or even China like it or not, will be built on different principles.
